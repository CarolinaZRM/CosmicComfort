                <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Develop and integrate at least 5 relaxation techniques, including breathing exercises and calming sounds, by week 15. Ensure each feature is functional, tested, and ready for user interaction, with detailed documentation on implementation.</li>
                    <li>Set up a system to send self-care reminders using Firebase push notifications by week 15. Ensure the feature is fully operational and includes functionality for users to manage reminder preferences. Document the implementation process and test for reliability and responsiveness.</li>
                    <li>Ensure the app can handle 500 concurrent users, as measured by stress and load tests. System performance must maintain an average response time of less than 2 seconds per request under full load, with less than a 5% failure rate. These results should be documented and available by week 16 of the project.</li>
                    <li>Ensure all app pages load within 2 seconds under a minimum load of 300 concurrent users by week 16. Conduct and document load tests, aiming for less than 5% error rate and 90% positive feedback on navigation flow.</li>
                </ol>
